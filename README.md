# 🚀 Setup Instructions

Welcome to the first lab!

Before you start, let's verify that your development environment is set up correctly.

## ✅ 1. Clone Your Repo Fork

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/campus-life-starter.git
cd campus-life-starter
```

## ✅ 2. Run Setup Script

We've provided a script to help to make sure your environment has all the necessary tools.

This script will verify:

- Git is installed

- VS Code is installed and accessible from the terminal

- Node is installed

```
bash check-setup.sh
```

##### ⚠️ If any checks fail:

No worries! We have instructions for each step in the Prework section of the Course portal. If you get stuck, please ask for help!

##### 🎉 When all checks pass:

Woo, you're ready to code! Try making a small change to this README file, and then pushing your first commit!
